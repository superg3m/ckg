The point of the ckit granular (ckg) is building out everything at a granular level  and then using these building block to build a good common use case version. so very few types and allocation is decided by the caller.

for CKIT allocation can happen by ckit because its suppose to be a nice wrapper around ckg

also establishes types

This is going to be a source and header file library.
